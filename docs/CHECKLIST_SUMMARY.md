## TDD Pattern Used

Each functional ticket follows this pattern:

1. **Create test file** (e.g., `apps/scraping/tests/test_models.py`)
2. **Write unit tests** for all functionality (before implementation)
3. **Create implementation file** (e.g., `apps/scraping/models.py`)
4. **Implement functionality** (models, views, tasks, etc.)
5. **Run tests** (`pytest path/to/test_file.py -v`)
6. **Fix failing tests** (debug and iterate until all pass)
7. **Manual verification** (browser testing, shell testing)
8. **Git commit and push**

---

## Task Granularity

- **Setup tasks**: 5-10 minutes each (file creation, configuration)
- **Test writing tasks**: 10-15 minutes each (write unit tests)
- **Implementation tasks**: 10-20 minutes each (implement methods, classes)
- **Verification tasks**: 5-10 minutes each (run tests, manual checks)
- **Git tasks**: 2-5 minutes each (commit, push)

**Average task duration:** 10-15 minutes  
**Total estimated time for completed sections:** ~50 hours

---

## Example Task Breakdown

### EXT-009: Scraping App Models (42 tasks)

**Test Writing (14 tasks):**
- EXT-009.1-2: Create test files
- EXT-009.3-14: Write unit tests for all model methods

**Implementation (18 tasks):**
- EXT-009.15-16: Create app and configure
- EXT-009.17-32: Implement models with all fields and methods

**Testing & Verification (8 tasks):**
- EXT-009.33-35: Create and apply migrations
- EXT-009.36-37: Run tests and fix failures
- EXT-009.38-40: Manual verification in Django shell

**Git (2 tasks):**
- EXT-009.41-42: Commit and push

---

## Usage Instructions

### For AI Coding Agents:

1. **Start with EXT-001.1** and work sequentially
2. **Check off each task** as completed: `- [x]`
3. **Follow TDD pattern**: Write tests before implementation
4. **Run tests frequently**: After each implementation task
5. **Verify manually**: Use browser/shell for verification tasks
6. **Commit regularly**: After each ticket completion

### For Human Developers:

1. **Use as a detailed roadmap** for implementation
2. **Adjust task order** if needed (but maintain TDD approach)
3. **Skip optional tasks** (e.g., EXT-008 Docker if not needed)
4. **Add custom tasks** as needed for your environment
5. **Track progress** by checking off completed tasks

## Estimated Completion

### Time Estimates:
- **Total Tasks:** 1,398
- **Average Time per Task:** 10 minutes
- **Base Estimated Time:** ~233 hours (~29 days at 8 hours/day)

### Adjusted for Reality:
- **Context switching:** +15% (~20 hours)
- **Debugging time:** +20% (~27 hours)
- **Integration issues:** +10% (~14 hours)
- **Documentation:** +5% (~7 hours)

**Total Realistic Estimate:** ~205 hours (~5 weeks at 40 hours/week)

This aligns with the original 8-week Phase 1 timeline when accounting for:

## Key Features

### 1. Unique Task IDs
Every task has a unique ID in format `TICKET-ID.TASK-ID`:
- `EXT-001.1`, `EXT-001.2`, etc.
- Easy to reference and track
- Enables parallel work on different tickets

### 2. Specific Commands
Every task includes exact commands to run:
- `python manage.py runserver`
- `pytest apps/scraping/tests/test_models.py -v`
- `git add . && git commit -m "message"`

### 3. Verification Steps
Every ticket includes verification tasks:
- Browser testing (http://localhost:8000/)
- Shell testing (`python manage.py shell`)
- Test execution (`pytest`)
- Manual checks (console, database)

### 4. Git Integration
Every ticket ends with git tasks:
- Add changed files
- Commit with descriptive message
- Push to remote
