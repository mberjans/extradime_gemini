## How to Use These Tickets

### For AI Coding Agents

1. **Start with EXT-001** (Django Project Initial Setup)
2. **Follow dependencies** - Only start a ticket when its dependencies are complete
3. **Check acceptance criteria** - Verify each criterion before marking ticket complete
4. **Run tests** - Execute testing requirements for each ticket
5. **Commit frequently** - Commit after completing each ticket
6. **Update status** - Mark tickets complete in the tracking section

### For Human Developers

1. **Review all tickets** - Understand the full scope
2. **Identify parallel work** - Assign tickets that can be done simultaneously
3. **Estimate sprint capacity** - Plan sprints based on time estimates
4. **Track progress** - Use the status tracking section or import to Jira/GitHub Issues
5. **Adjust as needed** - Update estimates and dependencies based on actual progress

### For Project Managers

1. **Import to project management tool** - Convert to Jira, GitHub Issues, or similar
2. **Assign to team members** - Distribute tickets based on expertise
3. **Track velocity** - Monitor actual vs estimated time
4. **Manage dependencies** - Ensure blocking tickets are prioritized
5. **Report progress** - Use completion percentage for stakeholder updates
