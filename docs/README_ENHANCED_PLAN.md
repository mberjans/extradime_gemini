2. **Prompt Templates:** Critical AI prompts not yet fully specified
3. **Integration Examples:** Some third-party integrations need more detail
4. **Advanced Features:** Phase 3-5 less detailed than Phase 1

### Adequacy for AI Implementation

**Current State:** 7/10
- Phase 1 is well-specified and implementable
- Core infrastructure has complete code examples
- Clear roadmap and task breakdown provided

**With Priority Additions:** 9/10
- Would cover all critical Phase 1 components

## Conclusion

This enhanced planning documentation transforms the original strategic plan into an actionable, AI-implementation-ready specification. While some sections still need completion (particularly prompt templates and additional model implementations), the foundation is solid and Phase 1 can be implemented following the provided guidance.

The modular structure allows for incremental completion while maintaining usability. An AI coding agent can begin implementation immediately using the completed sections, while remaining sections can be added as needed.

**Recommended Next Action:** Begin Phase 1 implementation following `docs/IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md`, using `docs/implementation_specs.md` for detailed code references, and adding missing sections as you encounter them in the implementation sequence.
